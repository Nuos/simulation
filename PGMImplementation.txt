This document covers the implementation details and challenges/questions for the transition from planetary mesh-based approach to a PGM-based approach. The implementation for this transition will be mainly derived from "Projective Grid Mapping for Planetary Terrain" by Joseph Mahsman.

Goals:
------
* proper texturing of closed surfaces : resolve problem at poles and at IDL (normals)
* multiple frustum rendering
* proper LOD for planetary rendering
* multiple dataset inclusion (high-res & low-res; polar & equirectangular)

Extensions:
-----------
* Proper dataset determination : checking the right datasets
* Streaming only the relevant chunks of the datasets (for very large datasets)
* Extension to allow planetary ocean rendering based on PGM
* Allow height determination for collision detectino
* rendering atmosphere & clouds this way?

Algorithm Functional Blocks:
----------------------------

Questions:
----------
* How well does this work at long range?
* Can it automatically scale the number of grid points based on distance?

Unresolved Issues:
