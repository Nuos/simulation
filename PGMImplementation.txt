This document covers the implementation details and challenges/questions for the transition from planetary mesh-based approach to a PGM-based approach. The implementation for this transition will be mainly derived from "Projective Grid Mapping for Planetary Terrain" by Joseph Mahsman.

Goals:
------
* multiple frustum rendering
* proper LOD for planetary rendering
* multiple dataset inclusion (high-res & low-res; polar & equirectangular)

Extensions:
-----------
